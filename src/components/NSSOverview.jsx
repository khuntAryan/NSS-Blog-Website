        National Service Scheme (NSS) is a widely recognized and influential youth-centric program in colleges across the country. NSS was established in 1969, the year Mahatma Gandhi celebrated his birth, with the primary goal of fostering the character and personality of student youth via volunteer community service. The ideals of Mahatma Gandhi provide inspiration for the NSS’s ideological stance. <strong>“NOT ME, BUT YOU”</strong> is the NSS motto.
